# Tinder

This project was created for the Brown Datathon 2019.

## Goal
We ask you some basic health questions and use the CDC 2017 survey data to predict diseases that you could have/develop based on users with similar answers.

## Twist
The app is TInder styled - diseases have a bio and a description with a set of Do's and Dont's. You can swipe right to learn more, or swipe left to skip.

## Tech Stack
The front-en is an Angular app and Back-End is a Django server.
